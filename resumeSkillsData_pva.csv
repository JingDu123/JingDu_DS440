It was intended that this plow would bring attention to the fact that the community has the option of calling 511, which would alert them of the road conditions before they would go out to work. As a small class of 5, it was naturally easier for us to converse with one another about our plans. I feel that I gained valuable experience by having the opportunity to work with a small team on this project.

28,5435,"10,4,8,8,11","<p>One of my favorite quotes about art is one by Cesar A. Cruz, ""Art should comfort the disturbed and disturb the comfortable."" While creating art, I tend to think of this quote. I do not make art to capture the likeness alone of things, nor to convey some hyperspecific idea; I may start at said idea, but along the way purposefully add layers of meanings to ensure that there will be multiple interpretations. The themes I often deal with include affairs of the mind and distressing aspects of society. Even in pieces made with the intention of being more of a study than anything else, there is this ghostly quality to them with their smooth gradients and often soft lines, and I find that these pieces can sometimes evoke feelings of dread or wariness - this is purposeful. What we express into society is filtered by what we percieve as valid to express...but when we look inside the mind there is no such censorship: only the raw, daunting realities of whatever may plague us or have our interests. To me, these rather surreal works have far more authenticity than they would have if being completely fitting to what we would see in our world. An artist I admire, Zdzislaw Bekinski said, ""I wish to paint in such a manner as if I were photographing dreams."" And I do as well. I connect with him because I too do not want to portray total realism, but the concerning gray area between that and cartoonism. Like Bekinski, I have an interest in showcasing the darker parts of life in my artwork, as I feel that has a deepness that can lead to revelations.</p>",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,pva

30,4724,"10,4,8,2,8,11","<p>Georgia O'Keefe once said, ""When you take a flower in your hand and really look at it, it's your world for the moment. I want to give that world to someone else. Most people in the city rush around so, they have no time to look at a flower. I want them to see it whether they want to or not.""<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Much like O'Keefe, who was known for her enlarged flowers, skulls, desert landscapes, my artwork is heavily inspired by the beauty of what surrounds us. I have always been enthralled with the natural world, and I want to share this fascination with those who view my artwork.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I don't want the people who view my work to simply&nbsp;<em>look&nbsp;</em>at it -&nbsp;I want them to feel a connection, one that will take them back to their roots, their past, the past in which it was possible for humanity to exist peacefully with the natural world without destroying it.<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The advances people have been making with technology, industry, and other fields are out of this world - quite literally. We have become a society that is so connected that there is now a disconnect. And it is getting to the point that if we don&rsquo;t change something about what we are doing,&nbsp;and if we don&rsquo;t acknowledge our mistakes and work to fix them, we will eventually die out.<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The cycle of life and death is another theme I touch on in my work. I believe that nothing is forever, that everything is ephemeral. This concept isn&rsquo;t something I shy away from.<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Whether it be something as small as the life cycle of a fly or as large as the survival of the human race, we are all bound to go at some point. I want my work to convey that life and death go hand in hand. We shouldn&rsquo;t deny death because it is a part of our being. We live and enjoy it as much as possible. I believe that we die, and we connect back to the earth, only later to become something new and different.<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I want my artwork to show this cycle, thus why I often use symbols of death, such as skulls and black snakes, and symbols of life, such as vibrant flowers and butterflies, intertwined together as one whole - the circle of life, essentially.<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Since writing this I have realized how truly difficult it is to describe why I make art - it&rsquo;s not something I do, but rather a part of me, and I can&rsquo;t properly convey that in writing. I can convey what themes are in my art, what I want from my art, but why I make art is a different story.</p>

36,5349,"4,4,11","<p>The day spent in Rothrock state forest reconstructing the stream habitat was filled with constructing and diverting the flow of water with logs held in place with barbs steel poles. John Ford, president of the National Youth Fly Fishing Team, was the sponsor for the days' events. He, among others, taught us the importance of water diversion in streams, especially this stream due to its close proximity to the road. The stream is slowly eroding the bank closer and closer to the road, so by diverting the water, the stream bank and road are saved. As the stream erodes, soil and nutrients are deposited into the water, possibly causing the stream ecosystem harm. The log systems are also very beneficial for trout who can live and use the logs as habitat. </p>

On this trip, I learned about a multitude of careers, but my favorite was probably that of a forester. This job normally only requires a bachelor&rsquo;s degree, but some have a Ph.D. A forester normally has good critical thinking and analytical skills so that they can work with the forest and react quickly and efficiently to any problems that arise. They also must be good with communication so that any collaboration between them and other groups, as well as the public, can run smoothly; as all will have a clear understanding of the situation. Foresters work to conserve forests for both recreational and commercial uses. They also restore damage to forests that were caused by logging, insects, wildfires, etc. In general, they maintain and manage forests, and make sure that all activity complies with government regulations. While on the job, I learned that foresters normally work in the field. I also learned that they often collaborate with other groups for restoration projects, like the one that was being done on Laurel Run. For example, they brought logs to create vanes with along the bank. I could see some of the work that had been done, like maintenance around the road and stream bank, and got to help restore the stream with them. </span></p>

However, my shading around the eyes, nose and hairline in my portrait looks really cool. My classmates said that it looks exactly like me, and that was the ULTIMATE compliment to me because I have always thought that I was horrible at drawing.

I have done two point perspective multiple times, I have found this to probably be a pretty simple kind of thing to do as you have to find the vanishing points and then find where the lines go. So Id say this is my favorit type of drawing where the objects in the drawing can be proportional to each other. This incorprates textureing and shadeing which is relitive to the direction of the light. Overall, takeing the Drawing II class expanded my skills some more as it helped me practic this kind of drawing with the textureing and shadeing of objects in the drawing. The class that I took really helped in that part as it really did expand all the things I learned, although this is one of many drawings, this class has expanded my horizion on how to draw drawings or how I should approach drawings to get a final project. Mostly what I expanded on in this drawing was textureing as before the brick texture might have been not really apprent or very diffrent from what it is now, then incorprateing the shadeing in the shadeing really aplified that texture. Although I found that I did not incorprate every single object from the original pricture which is prefectly fine as someone can control whats in their composition. So as a composition I learned that cropping a picture can help focus the compostion of the drawing. To summarize, the Drawing II class really expanded my horizion a bit more on how to draw objects within a composition with expanding my ability to texture and shade.</p>",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,pva

<p>Wetlands have different vegetation than dry ground. The plants of wetlands are water-loving. If you are wondering where solid ground stops and a wetland begins, look for a transition of plants.</p>
<p>Wetlands also have different soil chemistry. Dig a hole and examine the color and texture of the soil, and also examine where those change (eg. the soil is gray for 2 inches below the surface, rust 3 inches and below). There is an expensive guidebook that will tell you if the soils match that of wetlands. If you would like, you can look for other soil details such as smell, pH, etc.</p>
<p>Hydrology is the easiest question to answer. Is it wet? If not, it is not a wetland. If it is wet, look in the hole you dug for soils. If the soil beneath the surface is wet or if the hole is beginning to fill with water, you are in a wetland.</p>

You want to start by gathering the materials. They are athletic tape, pre wrap, and heel and lace pads, and Tuf-Skin. Then you should spray the clients foot with Tuf-Skin. It&rsquo;ll help the tape stay on and keep the taping tighter longer. Ask your client to keep their foot in dorsiflexion for the extent of the taping if it&rsquo;s a lateral sprain but if it&rsquo;s a medial sprain keep the foot in neutral.Then ask your client if they would like heel and lace pads. If they do, you would let the Tuf-Skin Dry a little bit and then apply them to the front of the ankle and also to the back of the ankle. These prevent blisters. Then go around the ankle with pre wrap starting at the top of the ankle and working your way down the foot and making sure you have all the area covered where you&rsquo;ll be taping. Then you want to pull off and rolls that have formed as to not create blisters. Then start at the top of the ankle and create and anchor on top of the pre wrap. Then make an anchor at the bottom of the foot. Then make a stirrup adding another anchor under the other one overlapping 50% and continue this pattern 3 times. The stirrups will start at the top of the first anchor every time pulling the tape down underneath the foot and back up the other side going to the top of the first anchor. If your client has a medial ankle sprain then you&rsquo;ll want to pull harder on the medial side. If your client has a sprain on the lateral side you&rsquo;ll want to pull harder on the lateral side. &nbsp;This prevents the ankle from rolling. Then make 4 heel locks. To make a heel lock, start with the tape vertical on the medial side pulling the tape under the foot then wrapping it behind the heel and back up in front of the ankle. You&rsquo;ll alternate this 2 times going medially and laterally. Then make figure 8&rsquo;s. To make a figure 8 start with the tape facing medially in the front of the foot above the ankle bones. Then pull the tape around the ankle back to where you started then down around the foot up the other side of the foot and back to where you started. Repeat this step 3 times. Then cover of any open spots of the tape. Always ask your client if the tape is too loose or too tight. If its to loose or too tight then redo the tape. </span></p>",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,pva

<p>- Growth of the pars intermedia occurs due to the degeneration of the hypothalamus, a region of the brain. The hypothalamus links the endocrine and nervous systems, playing key roles in controlling thirst, hunger, sleep, and mood.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- As the pars intermedia grows, it produces excessive amounts of various hormones, most importantly adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH). While ACTH performs many important tasks, it is known for its ability to affect cortisol levels. Cortisol, also known as the stress hormone, controls several body functions, including matinenance of blood sugar levels while a horse is fasting, generation of energy during exercise, activation of the ""fight or flight"" response, and important roles in detoxification, antioxidation, and infection-fighting pathways.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- High levels of cortisol can begin to destroy nearly every body system. Consistently elevated cortisol causes muscle-wasting, increases suseptibility to infection, and contributes to insulun resistance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Between 20 and 33% of all horses have been shown to develope this disease by the age of 20.</p>
<p>- Common of PPID signs are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lethargy, poor performance</li>
<li>Decreased muscling along the back</li>
<li>Delayed shedding or abnormal hair growth</li>
<li>Abnormal fat storage</li>

If they just have a scratch thats bleeding a little then you put gloves on and then spray/ wipe down the wound with alcohol or peroxide. Then cover it with either a bandaid but preferably gauze. Then put elasticon around the gauze or bandaid to help it stay on and get the athlete through the game. If the athlete has a large cut and is bleeding severely you will get gauze and apply pressure till the bleeding has stopped or slowed. If It hasn&rsquo;t slowed or it looks deep enough that it might need stitches then call the ambulance. To stop or slow a nosebleed you will want to use a tissue and have the athlete pinch the nose. This puts pressure on the nasal septum and often stops the bleeding. If not the bleed is probably coming from further in the nose. So proceed put a nose plug in the nostril/nostrils that are bleeding. Have the athlete tilt their head forward so blood doesn&rsquo;t run down the back of their throat.

The botulism bacterium is a spore-forming, anaerobic bacteria. It is commonly present in soil and in decaying animal carcasses. It occurs less often in decaying plant material. Hay, and especially haylage, can be contaminated with the botulism bacterium during the raking and baling process.

180,5357,"4,19","<p><strong>Accomplishment #1</strong></p>
<p>An accomplishment I would say is really important to me is learning how to program. Programming for me is sort of how I managed to learn more about how computer operate. It introduced me to the multiple syntaxs and termnology of programing. Learning to program set up the basic foundations of expanding my knowlage towards programming in multiple languages such as LUA, Python, and C++, although mostly starting with a hello world program in C++. Since I have first programmed a hello world program, I have learned to calculate numbers in the computer with varibles and constants. Later on I then learned about functions and decission makeing which allowed for more complex programs. And without learning programing, I probably would know less about how software and computers work; learning to program is an acomplishment.</p>
<p>Although I now know how to program, what specific event that lead to this accomplishment was when I took a class called Intro To Computer Programming in 9th grade. This class was the class where I wrote a hello world program in C++. The class started out with understanding the basics of a computer; looking at what parts a computer has. Of coarse it then tought me the importance of writeing down a solution before actually writeing code; I learned about puesudue code which is writeing down directions on how to get to the solution. Of coarse I also learned about diagrams that can be used to figure out the solution on what a person would like the computer to do, then afterwords it would be onto the programing. Mostly the class followed along with example programs that would usally take the entire class to complete as their was explain what each syntax and convention ment and how they worked. Althought it was very basic information, it was enough to learn how to program on my own as I had the foundation of programming basics in C++, Visual Basic, and Java. And to this day I consider learning to program as one of my greatest acomplishments.</p>
<p>In summary learning to program was a steping stone for me as an introduction to computing in general. In the future it will help with my own career and will be one of the most usefull things in my life. This acomplishment has made me greatfull that I had taken the class to beable to do things at the tips of my fingers as programming is fun. Without this acomplishment, I would not be sure what I would be doing without it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Accomplishment #2</strong></p>
<p>Besides programming, anther accomplishment is learning how to paint. Right after the 9th grade I was put into a Painting I class which tought painting. Before I could not actually paint really well and barly knew how to paint because I had only worked with water colors before, but they where not that great of water colors. So in this class I had learned all about the techniques used in painting. Then for the second half I was able to paint what I would have like to paint as required projects. Here I really practiced my painting skills on what works and does not work.</p>
<p>The first time around in the class we started with water colors and the first water color in that class I did was the Twin Towers because it was in September and the anversary of 911 was right around the corner. Of coarse we did multiple other watercolors, but then we started working with acrylic which is a type of paint that I wanted to try out because it was much thicker and could be layered unlike the water color. Acrylic would be the bases of all my projects for the second half. The projects I did paint was a landscape of the moon, the sea, a cityscape, unironicly Squidward from the Spongebob TV show that I watch a long time ago, ect. Basicly it really introduced a new scope of things to me for painting as I found painting to be more enjoyable.</p>
<p>Without that class I probabl would have not found that painting is really enjoyable; I am thankful that I even took that class to begin with. Mostly painting for me now is something that is very intresting by slaping paint on a canvas to create an image, although not actually slaping painting on a canvas, but rather applying paint. In summary, also learning to propperly paint is an acomplishment as it tought me to paint and to paint well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Accomplishment #3</strong></p>
<p>Anthor accomplishment that would most likely happen this year is graduateing. For a long time I have been going to school and for a long time I have wanted to go out in the world and work in a career job; getting a high school diploma will be a stepping stone and a big accomplishment for moveing forward in life as I will beable to go get a Bachlors Degree in computer science and hopefully move onto beging a game developer.</p>
<p>How I managed to get to this point is by going to school everyday and getting good grades in school. Mostly these things are the ways I can succeed in school to graduate; I have mostly done this in high school. But in elementry school I barely strived for much as I just went to school and that was pretty much it. I also had some other stuff happen in my life while the time I was in school. I also have been held back a year because I was put in school too early. To sum it up it was really just a long journey with ups and downs, but I am on the road to acheiveing this accomplishment after many years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In conclusion graduating will be a major acomplishment and will be a major one continueing forward in life. It has been a long journy with many other acomplishments in between. I have met many people over the years and done so manythings over the years that all my work in school would pay off by the time go getting a diploma.

Once I started the test I wanted to take a moment to sit down and relax before I started. I was so nervous and I knew I would only hurt myself that way. I got my score back and I passed. Later I got my card in the mail cconfirming that I passed. This helps because it is a well know certificate and I can cut out college classes because I passed a college level course.

<p>I went to shadow Dr. Pine who has been an orthodontist in State College for more than 30&nbsp; years. Through this experience, I learned what it means to be an Orthodontist and all the aspects that come along with it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The average orthodontist goes to school for 11 years and comes out and almost always can find work due to the highly competitive nature of&nbsp;this field. The schooling path contains 4 years of undergrad, 4 years of dental school, then 3 more years of Ortho school. Most Orthodontists in the past have opened up their own offices around the country. However, as times progress, there have become some main Orthodontist firms that hire Orthodontists to work for them, ceasing what has been known as ""family practices"".&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. Pine's main advice to anyone looking to go into this field of work is to, ""have a burning passion for helping people, and everything will fall in place.""</p>

Their objective is to build the tallest tower they can that can hold the big marshmallow on the top. Whoever builds the biggest tower is “who gets the job”. Before they are allowed to start building they have to design a blueprint of their model. And after they are done they have to write steps to how to build the model. Many of them were confused how this had to do with Agriculture, so I had them brainstorm. I asked questions like… Why would somebody need directions? What do people have to do before they start building anything? Why would it be important that someone else knows exactly how to build something? Then it clicked. The kids started talking about how they helped their Dad assemble a grill, or how they have legos with directions so they can build the object that they want to. I continued to tell them that whenever they get older and get a job that the first thing they will do is get trained and get told exactly how to do everything. I told them if you work somewhere and you have to build something, you will need an exact blueprint on what needs built. I also told them even to cook in your own home you need to follow the recipe or your food won’t turn out right. I explained to them that it is a very important life skill to be able to follow and give directions if you want everything you do to turn out how it is suppose to.</span></p>",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,pva

Mr. Howell and I split the class into two groups, one that was more experienced, and the other which was not. I helped the less experienced group, whcih was mostly made up of freshman and sophomore. I started by demonstrating the use of a circular saw by cutting a large piece of plywood into strips. One particular student had a little bit of difficulty half way through the cut. The student froze up and stopped the saw, so I checked to make sure they were okay, and it truned out that they were just nervous. So after a slight break, they tried again and did a great job. It was nice to see the student then go right into the next step, which was starting on a wooden clock project, and they have not looked back since. So all of the students are at different parts in their project, so Mr. Howell and I are monitoring and answering any of the questions that the student may have, while also being aure that all safety practices are still being followed. One student, who suffered a concussion outisde of school, is unable to work in the shop. So as a replacement, they are working on some tool identification worksheets, so when they are all healed up, they will be well equipped with knowledge to enter the shop and get right to work.&nbsp;</p>",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,pva

For this project the group had to research a population genetics over a series of generations. Our team decided we would research how a bottleneck event would affect the genes that the next generation would produce. Together we came up with a hypothesis. Our hypothesis was that the bottleneck event would completely cut out the recessive gene in a population. Our team also needed to do a variety of research about the bottleneck effect and about gene and how they are passed on. During research we each took a certain subject and came together and put it all together as a group. We decided it would be best to do a series of tests to get a better understanding on how this would look in an actual population. We used an online program that gave us randomized offspring when we put a desired percent of each trait we wanted present in. When we severely diminished the population the majority of the tests completely cut out the recessive trait. This is what our team was expecting. We also found that when the population gets severely diminished it could be that the random selection of those who live could give us an outcome of animals with mostly recessive traits. Through our abundant data we made a table that represented the highest outcome of results. Together we analyzed our data and how this relates and doesn&rsquo;t relate to a real world situation. Finally as a team we also had to come to a conclusion that the recessive trait would ultimately be diminished. As a group we presented our information in front of the class and answered a variety of questions from the class. Overall working together as a group we earned a 95% on this final project.</span></p>

In the Horticulture Unit, students received a specific topic about plants. &nbsp;We researched our topic and had to teach the rest of the class about it through an interactive presentation. My subject was about plant growth and development. To create this presentation I read a variety of information on my subject using both textbooks and information found online. During my research, I collected data, made a powerpoint that covered all of the important information, and connected it to how it is relevant to everyone&rsquo;s life. In my presentation, I had a series of discussion questions throughout and a variety of videos to enhance my lesson. When it came to presenting, I made sure that every important thing that I learned was expressed to the entire class. My ability to bring together and analyze a multitude of information gave me a grade of 100% on this project. This project enhanced my communication skills immensely. </span></p>

This project is called the genius hour project. We had to read three books that was about our topic of interest and learn everything we could about it. I picked how family farms are going out of business because of the economy. After I researched how the economy is hurting local farmers, I did even more research on how this situation could be repaired in the future. I came up with multiple action plans and attached them to a Ted Talk that I created about my project. One of my action plans for people to consider was buying local. I explained that if there was a local milk production plant for local farmers to take there milk to they would be making a lot more money. As the industry gets bigger and more widely spread the price per gallon is going up but the price the farmer is getting is going down. If farmers don't have to pay the price of getting there milk shipped to a huge plant somewhere far away and could take it locally they would be getting paid more with every gallon sold. Not only would it help the farmer it would supply a variety of new jobs within our community. The creation of these new jobs would economically benefit our local communities. This action plan was the plan I focused the majority on, because I have seen it work first hand. My Uncle Dan Itle is a co-owner of Vale Wood Farms. Stationed in Altoona, they are the only home delivery milk service in PA. They have their own local plant where milk comes from around their area and is used to make all the products that they sell. Since they are so successful they drive all the way to Center Hall, PA to deliver milk and products, including to Myers Diary which is another local production company. My intense research and ability to give multiple problem solving options gave me a 94% on this project and made me a more informed advocator for local farm production. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,pva

Mr. John Howell, the Penns Valley Agriculture teacher, is my supervisor. There was a lot of things that I had to learn and prepare for starting my internship. Mr. Howell taught me that you can’t be too lenient, that you want the kids to like you and focus on your teaching but you don’t want them to disrespect you. He also taught me that you have to make what you are teaching apply to your students’ life. The lesson needs to be interesting, or students are not going to want to hear what you have to say. I was told that the hardest part of being a teacher is keeping everyone on the right tract. This is so difficult because all kids learn differently and are at different levels. Since Agriculture is a mandatory class we have kids who love agriculture and students that are uninterested in this topic. Therefore, a lot of planning has to go into making everyone engaged in the lesson. My goal by the end of the internship is to have a strong respectful relationship with all my students and allow them to all be able to take away life lessons from this class. I learned that the majority of the kids respond well to projects that apply to their life. Recently, a majority of our projects are construction based. One project we had kids do a project called “Write It, Do It” where they had to make a object and write how to build it. This project was to improve their writing skills, learn how to provide detailed information, and increase their team work skills. Another project the students have been working on is building towers and bridges. This entails videos about famous towers and bridges, research and discussions about how they are strong, reading a series of blueprints, and working together to build it. Overall this experience is strengthening my ability to be a strong and respected teacher who has the ability to keep the kids engaged.     </span></p>",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,pva

For a project for Honors Senior Seminar, we had to work together to make a video on the Revolutionary War. We started by planning what we were going to do and how we were going to present our information. We then needed to research more information on the events we were given. The dates of certain events were divided evenly among us all. I researched all of the events I was given and came back together with my team so we could discuss what we had found. As someone was finding the pictures for the iMovie, I was working on recording the voice over for our presentation. My team and I finalized the iMovie and turned it in. On this project, we came together and worked very well and got all of the needed information; we got a 100 percent on our project. Working together on projects such as this one has taught me how to work with other people and collaborate to reach a specific goal. It has taught me to use each other&rsquo;s strengths to overcome an obstacle and figure out a problem. Teamwork, such as this, is very important when going into the workforce.

We had to communicate with our audience and make a presentation on how to solve a word problem. In this project, I walked the viewer through all of the steps you need to be able to get the correct answer. I started with the givens and what the word problem tells us, such as the vertical height of the cliff is 78.4 meters high. I showed all of the equations needed in order to solve the problem. I then explained to the viewer how to plug the givens into the equation. I showed in the keynote the math work to each of the equations, and then during class time while they were watching the presentation, they could ask me any questions they wanted. They were allowed to critique my project and I was able to see how they responded to it. We were able to talk to each other and discuss what I needed to do in order to make my presentation more advanced. Doing tasks like this help me talk with others about a task or problem I may have. My classmates can give me constructed criticism and I can use it to better my assignments. I can also discuss with them why I chose to do something a certain way.

The attachment to this entry is an example of a lab that I completed along with one of my classmates. We worked together to complete the experiment in class by taking turns carrying out parts of the procedure. Then we had to work together outside of class to organize the written lab report. We split up the work between each other so that it was completed quicker, and that way not all of the work would lay on one person&rsquo;s shoulders. For instance, I would work on the data and observations section while she worked on the analysis part of the report. After the other person completed their section of work, then the partner would read over it to check to see if all requirements were met and that there were no errors in the work. Working together as a team not only lessened the workload, but also allowed each person to show their strengths. This resulted in the best work that could be established. I believe that my ability to work with others through school projects, through my internship experience and at my summer job, has prepared me for real life and my future career.</span></p>

She taught us how to talk about ourselves so that we highlighted our skills and our personalities without sounding full of ourselves. Communication is a very critical part of life and everyone should know how to properly talk to others. Working with others goes much smoother if communication is where it needs to be. For example, if your boss is clear on your duties and responsibilities then you are able to complete your job to the best of your ability. Likewise, if you communicate what you have accomplished each day to your superior then they will know if more needs to be done the next day or if others need to do more to get everything done on time.

This challenge caught us by surprise and we had to use our critical thinking and problem solving skills to figure out how to properly carry out the experiment. I used what I had learned in the notes taken in class and the materials given to me to figure out how to find the concentration of the unknown solution. My teacher gave the class little aid in how we were supposed to determine the answer so we had to sit and think through the steps we had to take first before we could start testing. This skill of critical thinking and problem solving is a key component to possess in life. The answers are not always given to you so you have to be able to figure it out in order to be successful.

We also had to write possible errors that occurred when we were performing the lab. When errors would arise we had to analyze how they affected the outcome of the results.

Due to the fact that I am the president, I at the top of the chain of command underneath our advisor. &nbsp;As president of the Key Club, I have many duties such as organize and conduct meetings, complete paperwork, communicate to students, faculty and the community about upcoming events, and supply the club with prizes. Creating and organizing fundraisers is a large task that I undertake. I assign different people in the club tasks to complete so the fundraiser is a success. When organizing the food drive, I had to talk to the elementary Principal at the Intermediate school about the event. Getting approval from the principals is another example of understanding the chain of command. I have to understand who I should ask permission from in order to have the elementary schools participate in our events. During the food drive event, we had to figure out how to organize the food drive and pick up / drop off the collected items. While I was doing this I had others create flyers and collect boxes for the classrooms. When we went over to the elementary school we split into teams to pass out the boxes and the flyers. When it was time to collect all the cans, our club members were had to split into teams to count the items and determine a winner of the event. When a problem arose I had to handle the problem or report it to our club advisor. When it was time to take the food to the Millheim Food bank I had to organize who would be able to take the food and which club members could come help unload it. All of these decisions we presented to the supervisor of the club and she approved all of them. Throughout this process I learned that organizing a fundraiser can be difficult but in the end it was worth it because we gave back to the community. </span></p>",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,pva

So basically I had to divide that by the twelve months and do a bunch of other math so that my budget would be a monthly budget. The rubric gave certain circumstances that had to be accounted for, that was honestly the easiest part. It was easy to stay within my budget and end up with a surplus of a little over a thousand dollars considering all the stuff I was paying for was fairly cheap. That included rent, home expenses, recreation, self care, and investment. During the project I learned that it&rsquo;s easy to make a moderate budget stretch if you know what your doing.

The components of this project consisted of making a logo, other sources of advertisements, having an audience to sell our pitch to which was comprised of our classmates, and teachers who were the judges that voted on which was their favorite truck. This project is a great example of bringing out the soft skill of teamwork because it allowed each student in the group to contribute their thoughts and skills to make a great sales pitch. For instance someone in my group was good at making logos and was more of the artsy person in the group, while another person was good at putting words together, to sound more persuasive and interesting.

This gave me the opportunity to talk and educate the students, communicate with their teacher, and this also involved me in communicating to my supervisor as well. During this internship, I was creating lesson plans, and with one of my lesson plans their teacher observed me teaching like their boss (our principal or superintendent) would do with them. She then gave me critiques on my lesson plan and how I was executing my lesson plan to the students. Communicating with their teacher after the lesson allowed me to better my soft skill of communication. This will help me communicate to the students in a more clear fashion which is important to their education. The soft skill of communication also allows relationships to be built and the information for a project or in a workplace can be executed clearly. </span></p>

Having this opportunity to work with younger children has given me the opportunity to see if I wanted to pursue a career in Early Childhood Education, or possibly Special Education. I have also developed the skill of communicating with the student&rsquo;s teachers and the students themselves on a deeper understanding. Even though the students are not far from age from each other from first to fourth grade the way that I communicate by just talking to the students is different, which is important to know how to do.</p>",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,pva

Through this research I looked up health benefits for exercise, and how it can help improve your health both physically and mentally. With different types of exercises there are short term and long term effects that can overall have a big impact with your physical and mental health. I believe it is also important to note that when it comes to physical activity and differentiating the different types of exercise (anaerobic and aerobic) for both children and adults. Through my research I discovered that both children and adults both require exercise but they way they should exercise is different. For instance the amount of time they should exercise, which muscle groups they should focus on, and different activities they can do to improve their health. </span></p>

I think it is very important to know what your family&rsquo;s medical history is like, so that it can be subsided, and less likely to happen. Once one has common knowledge of their family health history and do the proper research on how to prevent it, they can live a healthier, longer life. One way to help benefit oneself is through the right exercises. By knowing this information I am able to take early action and better myself for my life in the future. By researching different health problems in my family, and by having the common knowledge of different types of exercises, and different activities that I can do, I can help solve the problems or try to prevent these problems that may occur in the future.

But the Interest Inventory provided information on what kind of job I&rsquo;d like, in this case, Investigative. The similarities for both were that the Career Cluster and Interest Inventory both were a series of questions that determined what I liked. However, they are also different because one is on paper while the other is on the web. Because of this, I would have to do the math by myself for the Career Cluster. Also, they both calculated different things I like. Those are the differences between both.</span></p>",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,pva

This week I created a project that had the kids pull a dog from a hat then research about the dog that they have picked. I provided a website that they could get their information from. And told them that they could also watch Dog 101 videos about their dog because it will also give them good information. During this project, I realized that most kids wanted to research their own dog. So I decided that if it was possible and there wouldn't be problems that kids could have their own dog. They had so much fun with this project and learned so much. The next couple of weeks we are going to have the kids present their information in front of the class and try to teach about each of their dogs and what owners they are best suited for.</p>",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,pva

This would be taken in 7th grade to 9th grade, then you would want to go to tech so you can learn more about equipment and how to run it. Also at tech you would learn more about seeding the right amount of seed when you plant your type of crop. The amount of time you should spend at tech is from 9th grade to 10th grade. Then in 11th grade to 12th grade you should take math and reading so you can have neat handwriting for in college and throughout your whole life, then take more math so you understand it for when you take harder classes in college. Then when your out of high school you should find a job that teaches you about plant growth and chemicals to use in fields or work on a farm that you can learn from and do your best to not mess up the farms normal routine.

However, I also feel that since I am so shy this might not be the greatest option for me. I would think that my results for social would be pretty high, but not as high as they are right now, I think that if I took the test again my social score would go down. I don&rsquo;t agree with my investigative score because I really do not like having to search for facts and figuring out mysteries. The reason why this is is because I get scared very easy, and if I see blood on something I would probably completely flip out. I think that my investigative score should have been at the most a 2, I think that if I took the test again my score would drop. I particularly agree with my enterprising score but I think it should have been higher since I do like persuading and leading people, and also trying to help people make decisions.

My options included a 4-year eductaion from Brown University, a 4-year education from Bucknell University, and a 2-year education from Albany State. My final choice was the 4-year education from Brown University because it fit my criteria and is an Ivy League school. While doing this project, I learned that it is important to compare all of your options and to have plans to fall back on if your favored option does not work out. I will use this in the future when I am looking at universities to attend because I can apply the DECIDE strategy to my process and limit the option number, making the choice simpler.</p>",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,pva

Lawyers can represent criminals, or just regular (innocent) people. A lawyer is what I would want to be the most, and then maybe a counseling psychologist.

I think those are the two most important things to do in this job because you need patience to wait for students and you need to be organized so you don&rsquo;t forget everything. I think that the job survey gave me accurate results because it said I was very artistic and partially social, and that is true because I love to write and draw. Also, mynextmove said I could be a good fit for a teacher and I agree. The personal connection that I have between being a middle school teacher is how in 5th grade, I helped out little kids at track and field and I really enjoyed teaching them. I also like teacher and learning new things because you can always learn something new. Also, another job I think is a good choice for me is a kindergarten teacher because all they have to learn is colors, shapes, words, and letters and I can easily teach those.

Whether it is on the field, or in the workplace, communication is a great skill to have. My coaches have always said that you should talk during a play because if you do not say anything, then how are your teammates going to know what is going on. If an offensive lineman doesn't call out a player who they believe might blitz, then how is the play going to be blocked well. If a linebacker does not call out the strength of the play, then how is the defensive line going to know which gap to line up in. This form of communication is what is used to perform the best that you can in football. These call-outs need to occur for a team to succeed, or give it their best shot. This can be converted over to the workplace because communication allows people to complete projects, or even if someone has to complete something for someone else to use for their own project.</p>",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,pva

Also, if it is something that is completely out of my knowledge, I will ask my coworkers or supervisors. Generally, I have been able to use my own knowledge, whether I received it from a teacher, or myself in research, to solve problems. Critical thinking comes in handy when I am trying to answer either questions that have to do with ethics or short answer questions that I have to complete with using a certain amount of words.

1482,5281,"10,18","<p>For my senior year of high school, I have worked as an intern at Johnson Brothers Accounting. I have done multiple things throughout this internship. For the first half of the school year, I had learned the basics of payroll, general ledger, scanning, and also learned how taxes work. For the second half of the year, I am mainly doing payroll one day, and general ledger for the rest of the week, unless I am told otherwise. I have learned my place in the work is to complete any work that can be completed. For my work to be accepted, my payroll sheets have to be looked over by two people to ensure I am sending out the correct information. Also, my work in general ledger has to be checked over by one person, then sent to the boss who looks over it, then sends it back to me to be completed and send out any more documents that are requested. The process for one account to receive their checkbook information requires everyone in the office to complete their assignments. It starts with payroll, completing the checkbooks and telling them what taxes they need to pay. Then it would be checked over by a tax officer to make sure the tax information is one-hundred percent correct. Then an account sends in their own checkbooks and possibly a bank statement, which most accounts have, to be reconciled. After the reconciliation, the accounts transactions basically need to be checked to see if they are logical when then were put into the system during the reconciliation. But once the boss checks it over, it gets sent back for any more documents then sent out to the client for them to receive their updated checkbook balance. Previously, it took me the whole hour I had to complete maybe one or two very small accounts in payroll, but now, I have more time and I am able to complete as many accounts they need me to do in one day. The same thing can be said about the general ledger work, but since this process takes more information to complete an account, it still takes me one or two days for one account to be completed, but now I can plug in all the&nbsp;checks and deposits the account has done in less than one day. This is my understanding of the workplace through an accounting internship.</p>",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,pva

In one of my completed courses, Civics and Economics; this year I have completed numerous projects that demonstrate my ability to communicate my thoughts, opinions, and ideas in a very clear and effective way. I completed a project based on researching bias in media and public opinion. This topic could be seen as difficult to handle because it is such a broad and diverse topic. However communicating information is one of the easiest things to do. The presentation includes visual images to help the viewer understand what is being discussed in the text, as well as verbal communication that was given when the project was presented to an audience. The main goal was to educate others about bias in the media instead of inserting their opinion. It is wise to communicate your viewpoint and opinion but not to persuade the audience.

My criteria were&nbsp;I would like the cost to be more on the cheaper side, less than 20,000 for tuition, I also want to live within the state, or preferably closer to home, I would also like to have the school be in a nicer area of the state, alongside I want the area to also be less populated, finally I want to have a discount on my education.&nbsp;I picked Penn State at University Park because it is closer to home, it&rsquo;s in a nice area, I get a discount, travel will be easier, I can live at home, and the University has degrees I want.
